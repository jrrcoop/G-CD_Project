## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
##### *This respository contains my run_analysis.R script, the source data required to run it, and copies of the txt documents it creates.  
##### *In order for the script to work, data should be unaltered (in the same folder, not compressed, and with the same names).
##### *Ensure that the source data folder and run_analysis.R script are in your working directory.
##### *The produced table "tidy_data_w_averages.txt" is the cleaned data set.
